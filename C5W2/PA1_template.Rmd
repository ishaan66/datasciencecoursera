```

## Loading and Preprocessing
```{r preprocessing}
# Load the data
activity_data <- read.csv("activity.csv")

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
head(activity_data)
```

## What is the mean total number of steps taken per day?

```{r mean steps}
# Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
total_steps_per_day <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity_data, sum, na.rm = TRUE)

# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
hist(total_steps_per_day$steps, main = "Histogram of Total Steps per Day",
     xlab = "Total Steps per Day", ylab = "Frequency", col = "skyblue", border = "black")
```

```{r median steps}
# Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
mean_steps_per_day <- mean(total_steps_per_day$steps)
median_steps_per_day <- median(total_steps_per_day$steps)

# Display mean and median
mean_steps_per_day
median_steps_per_day
## Including Plots
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

```{r activity pattern}
# Calculate the average number of steps taken for each 5-minute interval across all days
average_steps_per_interval <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, activity_data, mean, na.rm = TRUE)

# Make a time series plot
plot(average_steps_per_interval$interval, average_steps_per_interval$steps, type = "l",
     main = "Average Daily Activity Pattern", xlab = "5-Minute Interval", ylab = "Average Steps")
```
```{r max interval}
# Find the 5-minute interval with the maximum average number of steps
max_interval <- average_steps_per_interval[which.max(average_steps_per_interval$steps), ]

# Display the interval with the maximum average number of steps
max_interval
```

## Inputing missing values

```{r missing values}
# Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset
total_missing_values <- sum(is.na(activity_data$steps))

# Display the total number of missing values
total_missing_values
```
```{r activity data}
# Devise a strategy for filling in missing values (e.g., using mean for each 5-minute interval)
fill_missing_values <- function(df) {
  df$steps[is.na(df$steps)] <- mean(df$steps, na.rm = TRUE)
  return(df)
}

# Apply the strategy to create a new dataset with filled-in missing values
activity_data_imputed <- fill_missing_values(activity_data)
```
```{r total_steps}
# Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day for the imputed dataset
total_steps_per_day_imputed <- aggregate(steps ~ date, activity_data_imputed, sum)

hist(total_steps_per_day_imputed$steps, main = "Histogram of Total Steps per Day (Imputed)",
     xlab = "Total Steps per Day", ylab = "Frequency", col = "lightgreen", border = "black")

```

```{r steps per day}
# Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day for the imputed dataset
mean_steps_per_day_imputed <- mean(total_steps_per_day_imputed$steps)
median_steps_per_day_imputed <- median(total_steps_per_day_imputed$steps)

# Display mean and median for the imputed dataset
mean_steps_per_day_imputed
median_steps_per_day_imputed
```
```{r comparison}
# Compare the estimates before and after imputing missing data
comparison_df <- data.frame(
  Metric = c("Mean Steps per Day", "Median Steps per Day"),
  Original = c(mean_steps_per_day, median_steps_per_day),
  Imputed = c(mean_steps_per_day_imputed, median_steps_per_day_imputed)
)

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?

```{r weekday vs weekend}
# Create a new factor variable indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day
activity_data_imputed$day_type <- ifelse(weekdays(as.Date(activity_data_imputed$date)) %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday"), "weekend", "weekday")

# Calculate the average number of steps for each 5-minute interval, grouped by day type
average_steps_per_interval_day_type <- aggregate(steps ~ interval + day_type, activity_data_imputed, mean)

# Make a panel plot containing a time series plot for weekday and weekend activity patterns
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(average_steps_per_interval_day_type, aes(x = interval, y = steps)) +
  geom_line(aes(group = day_type, color = day_type)) +
  labs(title = "Average Daily Activity Pattern by Day Type",
       x = "5-Minute Interval", y = "Average Steps") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("weekday" = "blue", "weekend" = "red")) +
